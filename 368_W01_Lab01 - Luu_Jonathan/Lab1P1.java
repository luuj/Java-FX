    The most common problem that new Java programmer face
    is the compilers response to a missing semi-colon.  It's not real
    clear where and what the problem is.  So this simple, two statement
    Java program is missing a semi-colon in the first output statement.

	You will see a red circle with an 'x' in it on line 19. If you hover your
	cursor over that red circle, it will display the error message. You can also
	see a small red squiggly line at the end of line 19 showing you where Eclipse
	believes the error is at.
	
	Fix the line and run the program by clicking on the green circle, just below
	the menu line that looks like a 'play' button.
