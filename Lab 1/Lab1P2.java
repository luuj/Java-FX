    Another common problem is a missing quote mark on a string literal.
    Again it comes down to trying to make sense of what the compiler is
    trying to tell you.  So this simple, two statement
    Java program is missing a quote mark in both output statements.
    Note that it makes a difference which one is missing

    You will see errors on lines 17 and 18. Notice that the compiler is confused
    as to what is actually going on somewhat. One of the suggestions is that
    you have a string that is not properly surrounded by quote marks.
    
    Add the missing quote marks to both lines and run the program.
